This type of ischiogluteal bursitis is commonly referred as ‘weaver’s bottom’. Sitting for a prolonged period can increase wear and tear on the bursa causing microtrauma. Over time, this can result in bursal thickening, inflammation and bursitis. This can also occur with tight muscles around the bursa. The ischiogluteal bursa works to allow the gluteal and hamstring muscles to slide smoothly and without friction over the nearby bone (ischial tuberosity). When these muscles are excessively tight, they place increased pressure and friction on the bursa, resulting in bursitis."

Rarely these changes ever cause pain however at times in the lower back (lumbar) where these slowly formed changes occur it can lead to joint pain, stiffness and reduced range of movement. Common symptoms are pain localised to the lower lower lumbar spine (L4, L5 area), a gradual onset of symptoms, clicking.

There are many different types of scoliosis that can develop at various stages of someone’s life from child to adulthood with the most common type being Adolescent Idiopathic (ages between 10-19 with no known cause). Many people are able to lead a pain free life with these changes, while some experience symptoms of back, rib, chest and hip pain. These symptoms vary from person to person and are not linked to the shape or amount of change detected. Physiotherapists can help develop strategies that are important to help manage Scoliosis and at times can prevent further changes. Treatments that may help include hydrotherapy, massage along with exercises that strengthen and stretch your back and stomach muscles. Physiotherapists are also able to identify and work with the health care professionals that may be able to help with ongoing or changing symptoms if indicated."

There are three main phases to this condition with the first being the ‘freezing’ stage where the shoulder is very painful without any exact reason for this pain and there is gradual loss of shoulder movement. The second stage is the ‘frozen’ stage where there is a lot of stiffness and reduced movement of the shoulder but with less pain. The final stage is the ‘thawing’ phase where the shoulder gradually increases its range of movement. This condition is self-limiting and usually runs its course between 12 months to 2 years. In this time physiotherapy can be very beneficial to restore movement and function, decrease pain levels and help to guide management of this condition. The main symptoms associated with frozen shoulder are a dull or aching pain in your affected shoulder, which is often worse at night or when you move your shoulder joint. Another symptom is stiffness around your shoulder joint that may stop you from moving your shoulder normally. This can make it difficult to do everyday tasks such as driving or dressing yourself."

It’s often felt as a pain in the shoulder itself or the upper arm. It typically does not radiate down to the hand. Most people will not associate it with a specific injury per se, but rather that it came on over a few days or weeks. In most cases, the small tendons that operate the ball and socket joint of the shoulder will be the ‘pain driver’. Muscles and tendons can start to generate pain for different reasons but one of the most common causes is thought to be a gradual deconditioning or under-loading of the muscles over time. Once painful, the tendons then react to being used (eg lifting the arm), inducing pain and making simple tasks very difficult. Resting the arm often makes the pain ease in the moment but doesn’t address the underlying cause. "

The pain can sometimes radiate down the front and outside portion of the thigh. There can be swelling or bruising of the hip and tenderness to the touch. Other symptoms include general hip stiffness, decreased hip movement and pain when lying on the affected side especially on hard surfaces. Pain is usually worse when going up or down stairs or standing for too long. You may notice walking becoming painful which can also cause pain in the knee or lower back. Common causes include a spike in training routines as well as a muscular imbalance with weakness of the gluteal, hamstring, quad, abductor, adductor and hip flexor muscles. Other causes link to repetitive hip movements in sports such as cycling, running and hockey.

Rehabilitation time scales vary mainly on how long you have been experiencing the symptoms."

It’s usually caused by repeated movements such as gardening or typing. It is often due to overuse of a group of muscles in your forearm which attach to the outside point of your elbow where the tendon attaching the muscles to the bone develop tiny tears and then thicken and swells causing pain and tenderness. Pain is usually worse when you bend and straighten your elbow and your wrist. It can also progress to getting pain when gripping or twisting your hand. The pain can vary from mild discomfort to severe pain that keeps you awake at night. Often when rest can be helpful to reduce the pain but pain then reappears when you start doing the same movements as was previously painful. Because of this it is useful to see a physiotherapist who can help prescribe exercises to restore function and reduce pain."

Symptoms include focal pain and sometimes widespread pain that originate from the inside of the elbow, pain and weakness when opening jars or gripping items and struggling to fully straighten your elbow. The majority of people who develop these symptoms have recently increased their level of activity or slightly changed their routine for example an increase in gardening, typing or an increase in resistance training. You can develop symptoms at any age but commonly people are between 40-60 years old. Factors that increase your risk of developing this condition are if you have diabetes (type 1 and 2), if you smoke, have high cholesterol levels, prone to a sedentary lifestyle, overweight and eat fatty foods on a regular basis. Reassuringly after a clinical diagnosis is made there is strong evidence that symptoms can improve over time with an individualised physiotherapy plan."

Swelling and bruising are common with these injuries. An ankle sprain generally happens when playing sports but can also occur in everyday life from a simple trip or change of direction or awkward landing on one foot. There are three varying levels to an ankle sprain with grade 1 being a mild sprain, 2 being moderate and 3 being a full rupture of a certain ligament(s). It is important that the degree of injury is diagnosed as this determines the management. Pain normally dissipates after a few weeks however the greatest risk for an ankle sprain is a previous injury/sprain so a good rehabilitation plan is needed to avoid a future injury. It is recommended to consult a physiotherapist to help increase the chances of an optimal recovery. During your session the physiotherapist will evaluate your ankle stability and overall strength of the area and assess the surrounding joints (knee and the hip) to identify any compensations that can be addressed. This will be key to minimise the risks of re-injury and help the you return in an improved physical state compared to before the initial injury."

During walking, running or jumping the achilles tendon main role is to absorb, store and use energy to act in a spring like manner to propel the body forwards. An imbalance in this storing/recovering system can lead to the tendon becoming overloaded or worse a tear which can be partial or full. An irritation of the achilles tendon can happen due to overloading, repetitive strain, or even a trauma. The most common context leading to achilles tendon pain is running. Multiple factors can cause these symptoms that include returning to activity after a period of inactivity, imbalances of posture during activity further up the leg (kinetic chain), poor shoe wear support or restricted foot mobility. Typical symptoms include swelling, redness of the area or even a sensation of heat can be felt. The achilles becomes painful on walking, running or hopping and a common characteristic is stiffness in the mornings that can be relieved with rest. The treatment options vary according to the individual, a physiotherapist can help advise the correct exercises and management for your injury. Shockwave therapy has been shown to have excellent results in the resolution of Achilles tendinopathy issues and is something we use here at Flex physio."

Your physio will take a detailed history in order to diagnose and find out the root cause of your issue before treatment begins. Treatment generally consists of specific exercises to target the painful area and its root cause. Your physiotherapist will advise regarding pain management and potentially suggest use of orthotics. As a second line option here at the clinic we also use shockwave therapy which has been proven to provide excellent results when it comes to plantar foot pain.

If they are not allowed to heal and are subjected to further loading then the micro fractures remain an increasing symptom. Symptoms may include a gradual onset of “tooth aching” pain, tenderness when palpated and pain on “normal” activities such as walking. The main causes are linked to overuse injuries such as running or sports involving high levels of endurance. People who are at risk of developing a stress fracture are those who have changed surface or increased their training load. A physiotherapist will be able to assist in diagnosing these symptoms and that will involve imaging the painful area. Once confirmed appropriated management will be advised and support provided with a graded return to your activity. "

Your physio will take a detailed history in order to diagnose and find out the root cause of your issue before treatment begins. Treatment generally consists of specific exercises to target the painful area and its root cause. Your physio will advise regarding pain management as well which could include prescription of orthotics. As a second line option here at the clinic we also use shockwave therapy which has been proven to provide excellent results when it comes to plantar fasciitis. Plantar fasciitis usually resolves within 6 to 18 months without treatment. With accurate precautions and consistent therapy, the 95% of people with plantar fasciitis are able to recover within 6 months."
